//display current day at top of calendar

//create timeblocks for business hours (9am - 5pm)
//use bootstrap grid for this. 
// also, note style.css includes classes for timeblock, row, hour, past, present, future, saveBtn, so assign classes accordingly probably using jQuery in some cases...



//color-code timeblock to indicate past, present or future



//click in time block to enter an event


//click save button for time block to save to local storage


//when page is refreshed, saved event persists.
